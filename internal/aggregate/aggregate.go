// Package aggregate Aggregates draw a boundary around one or more Entities.
// An Aggregate enforces invariants for all its Entities for any operation it supports.
// Each Aggregate has a Root Entity, which is the only member of the Aggregate that any object outside the Aggregate is allowed to hold a reference to.
